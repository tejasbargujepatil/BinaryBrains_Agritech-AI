    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
    ISRIC_API_URL=https://rest.isric.org

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

-   **Location Issues**: Ensure Location permissions are granted on the device.
-   **API Errors**: specific 404s usually mean the backend is unreachable or the API key is invalid. Check `.env`.
-   **Build Errors**: Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get` to reset cache.
